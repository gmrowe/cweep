# mines

A minesweeper clone in C. The graphical layer is handled by raylib.
The project is strictly a learning exercise. Should get some decent C knowlege
out of it.

# Build

To build the project, run build.sh

``` shell
./build.sh
```

This should build the `mines` executable. Then just run it:

``` shell
./mines
```

# TODO

[] Literally everything!
